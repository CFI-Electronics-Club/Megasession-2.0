Now a days technology grown too much that our life becomes so easier and we are much dependent on them. They are doing a lot of work for us. Let's see an example of how to control an LED with Google Assistant (IoT). You can find the code for the [controlling LED and buzzer](https://github.com/CFI-Electronics-Club/Megasession-2.0/blob/main/GoogleAssistant/LED_Buzzer) and [Temperature Server](https://github.com/CFI-Electronics-Club/Megasession-2.0/blob/main/GoogleAssistant/Temperature%20Webserver) and download [data.zip](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CFI-Electronics-Club/Megasession-2.0/main/GoogleAssistant/data.zip) from the links given.

Duck hunt gaming console is a console where we play the popular duck hunt game using the ESP32, peripheral shield, joystick and OLED display. Through this session, participants were introduced to the working of the OLED display and the joystick, and were able to make this project using those basic principles. The code of the duck hunt game is given [here](https://github.com/CFI-Electronics-Club/Megasession-2.0/blob/main/Duck%20Hunt/Duck_hunt.ino)
